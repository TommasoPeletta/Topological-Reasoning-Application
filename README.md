# Topological-Reasoning-Application


### Description

This project consists of exploring the use of model logic to reason about topological properties.  
More precisely we will test the limits and the strong points of VoxLogicA, a spatial model checker used for image analysis.  
The idea is to take some videogames' map and segment some attribute of it.  
We focused in the Apex legend season 1 map and we have segmented the buildings, the mountains and the choke points.  
For more information you can look at the References and the Docs folder.
